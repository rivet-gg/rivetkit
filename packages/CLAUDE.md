# agentOS Packages

- Client packages must stay same-version with the sidecar: assert the single protocol version integer, and do not add wire back-compat, runtime negotiation, or converters.
- Generated client layers return raw generated protocol types; the `AgentOs`
  facade is implemented in `@rivet-dev/agentos-core` and publicly exported from
  `@rivet-dev/agentos`. User-facing docs and examples must import the public
  package, not the internal core package.
- Generic agentos clients must stay application-agnostic and forward only the
  sandbox protocol.
- agentos packages must never depend on agent-os packages; dependency direction is strictly agent-os to agentos and must be CI-enforced after the split.
- The sidecar remains the source of truth for runtime behavior; TypeScript package code should forward generated requests instead of reimplementing sidecar state machines.
- Language modules own their ecosystem's common end-to-end workflows: source
  and file execution, value evaluation, dependency installation, project entry
  points, and standard module/script workflows must not require users to invoke
  `node`, `python`, `python -m`, `npm`, or `pip`. Add typed, injection-safe
  helpers for stable intents, not one method per CLI flag; keep `exec`,
  `execArgv`, and `spawn` as the uncommon-command escape hatch.
- Cron and agent configuration types are Rust-owned after the split; TypeScript packages may re-export or mirror them only in lockstep.

## React UI (dashboard inspector)

- Never `setState` from a `useEffect` to derive state from props, query data, or
  other state. Derive it during render (`useMemo`), or reset it during render by
  comparing against the value it is keyed on. Effects are for subscriptions,
  timers, and imperative cleanup only.
- Server mutations use `useMutation`; do not hand-roll `busy`/`error` state
  around an `async` handler.
- Coupled state that always changes together belongs in one `useReducer` (or one
  state object), not in a pile of independent `useState` calls updated in
  sequence.
- Imperative browser resources (object URLs, observers, listeners) belong in a
  self-contained hook that owns both creation and cleanup.
