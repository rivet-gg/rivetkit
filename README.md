# agentOS

agentOS is a lightweight Linux-compatible VM runtime for isolated filesystem,
process, terminal, language, and networking workloads.

It ships in two forms:

- a fixed Rust Rivet actor named `agentOS`, accessed through a generated
  TypeScript contract;
- `@rivet-dev/agentos-core`, the embedded TypeScript API for trusted Node.js
  applications.

The actor is a thin lifecycle and transport wrapper around Core. It does not
contain a configurable TypeScript actor implementation.

## Hosted actor

```bash
npm install @rivet-dev/agentos rivetkit
```

```ts
import { createAgentOsClient } from "@rivet-dev/agentos";

const client = createAgentOsClient();
const vm = client.agentOS.getOrCreate(["workspaces", "demo"], {
  createWithInput: {
    config: {
      filesystem: {
        root: { type: "actor-sqlite", namespace: "root" },
      },
    },
  },
});

await vm.filesystem.writeFile({
  path: "/home/agentos/hello.txt",
  content: "hello\n",
});

const result = await vm.process.exec({
  command: "cat /home/agentos/hello.txt",
  options: { env: {}, captureStdio: true },
});

console.log(result.stdout);
```

Creation config is used only when the actor is first created. Read the complete
normalized config with `config.get`; replace it with `config.set`. Replacement
is whole-object normalization, so omitted properties return to their defaults.

Hosted actions are grouped under:

- `config` and `runtime`
- `filesystem`
- `process` and `terminal`
- `contexts`, `javascript`, `typescript`, and `python`
- `network.fetch`, `network.fetchStream`, and `network.preview`
- `software`
- `cron`

The hosted actor accepts only serializable, whitelisted filesystem descriptors.
It never accepts host mounts, host paths, JavaScript VFS objects, callbacks, or
host bindings.

## Software

Software is an immutable v2 `.aospkg` artifact. Hosted actors install HTTPS
URLs:

```ts
await vm.software.install({
  source: {
    url: "https://packages.example.com/ripgrep.aospkg",
    digest: "sha256:<64 lowercase hex characters>",
  },
});
```

The process-wide cache is content-addressed by digest. Release tooling uploads
the catalog to S3-compatible object storage and emits a manifest of relative
artifact URLs, digests, and sizes. Runtime software is not resolved from npm.

## Embedded Core

```bash
npm install @rivet-dev/agentos-core
```

```ts
import { AgentOs } from "@rivet-dev/agentos-core";

const vm = await AgentOs.create();
try {
  await vm.filesystem.writeFile("/tmp/hello.txt", "hello\n");
  console.log((await vm.process.exec("cat /tmp/hello.txt")).stdout);
} finally {
  await vm.dispose();
}
```

Embedded Core additionally supports trusted local `.aospkg` paths, host-backed
mount plugins, external VM providers, and host bindings. Those capabilities stay
inside the embedding process and are intentionally absent from the hosted actor.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
pnpm check-types
cargo check --workspace
```

Rebuild the complete command catalog and stage the local object-store release
layout with:

```bash
just tools-rebuild
just software-artifacts-dry-run
```
